//In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. 
//It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable.
 //Unlike most languages where array is a reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array 
 //is a single variable that stores multiple elements.
//Declaration of an Array 
//There are basically two ways to declare an array. 


//Example:  

var House = [ ]; // method 1 

var House = new Array(); // method 2 



var array = prompt('Arrays yay!!');
console.log(array)

const friends = ['john', 'peter', 'excel', 'wisdom','bob','susy', 45, undefined, null];
console.log(friends)


// Array Length
friends['length']

//Re-asign 
let bestfriend = friends[2];
console.log(bestfriend);
